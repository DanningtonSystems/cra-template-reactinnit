# React, innit?
`Reactinnit` is a CRA (create-react-app) template based on the default `cra-template` used by default in Create React App. It's meant to be a more organised version of cra-template. Reactinnit is used in [Devbox](https://github.com/DanningtonSystems/devbox) and can be used standalone with Create React App.

There is currently no TypeScript variation of Reactinnit. However, feel free to add a PR to [the Reactinnit TypeScript repository](https://github.com/DanningtonSystems/cra-template-reactinnit-ts/pullls) if you'd like to help with creating a TypeScript version of Reactinnit.

## Usage

To use Reactinnit with Yarn, use a command like the following:

`yarn create react-app [application name or . for current directory] --template reactinnit`

With NPM, you can use:

`npx create-react-app [application name or . for current directory] --template reactinnit`
